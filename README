# AirFlurry
AirFlurry is an ADOBE AIR Native Extension (ANE) to send analytics content to Flurry Server.
It works both for iOS and Android devices.
@see http://www.flurry.com/

# Use
Refer to the flurry documentation to see how to use it.
This ANE is just a Wrapper of the flurry API. Everything that can be done on each language (Objective-C or JAVA), is callable from the main swc.

# Installation
The ANE is already compiled. You can find it under the folder Binaries. 
If you want to recompile it, just run ant in the same directory, after changing the parameters (called properties) in build.xml.
You will also have to link the libs Flurry.jar and Flurry3.1.0 to their projects (NativeAndroid/ and NativeIOS/)

# IOS Compilation
The iOS library has been compiled using the sdk iOS 4.3 and deployment target set to iOS 4.0, using GCC 4.2.
This ANE has NOT been tested with an sdk version superior to iOS 4.3.

It is distributed under Apache 2.0 license.
